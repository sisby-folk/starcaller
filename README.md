_Starcaller_ allows players to:
 - Observe the 780 vanilla stars with unique names (while holding the _Starcaller's Spear_)
 - Pull stars down from the sky with the spear, holding them in the inventory as _Stardust_.
 - Dye stardust any color, affecting the star once it reappears after 60 seconds.
 - Release stars back into the sky early by dropping their dust.
 - See who last recolored a star by inspecting its dust.
